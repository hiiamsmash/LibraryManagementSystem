A Long Tale
A Long Tale is an exciting activity that requires teammates to create a story. In this activity, teammates will create an ongoing tale as a team.

To play:

The first player will begin the tale with a sentence and stop randomly.
The second player will then continue this tale with a random sentence of their own.
The teammates will keep taking turns adding funny, outrageous, scary, or horrifying subsequent sentences to the tale.
The players will continue in this fashion until the story reaches a natural end.
The tale can be as outrageous or as funny as the teammates make it.
This activity challenges teammatesâ€™ wits and encourages them to work hand in hand to achieve a common goal.
